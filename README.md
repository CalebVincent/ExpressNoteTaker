The Express Note Taker allows someone to save personal notes locally to their system, only accessible to those on the same device.

# Getting Started

When you run the program a welcome page will greet you displaying a button that directs you to the page where previously saved notes are displayed, along with 2 input boxes for a title and body of the new note to be saved.

2 icons on the top right navbar allow the user to clear inputs in the case a new note must be promptly recorded, and to save the actual note itself to the local database.
